> Greenbaum Labs is a personal AI workshop running on local compute. Founded by Justin R. Greenbaum. Builds diagnostic systems, analytical frameworks, and AI instruments for measuring organizational alignment. All inference runs on owned hardware — no cloud dependency.

## Primary Project: Coherence Diagnostic Engine (GL-001)
Measures alignment between what organizations say (center) and what the world observes (edge). Produces structured diagnostic reports scoring on Truth, Authority, and Continuity using the Coherence Triangle. Product category: Decision & Responsibility Infrastructure (DRI).

## Infrastructure
- NVIDIA DGX Spark (Grace Blackwell GB10, 128GB unified memory) — primary compute
- Synology NAS (10 GbE) — filesystem-as-truth-store
- Mac Studio — interface and workstation
- Local models via Ollama (qwen3:32b, nomic-embed-text)

## Operating Principles
1. Own the compute
2. Filesystem is source of truth
3. Automation observes, summarizes, suggests — never decides (AR-001)
4. Ship gifts, not pitches
5. Build ahead of demand
