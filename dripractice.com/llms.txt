> Decision & Responsibility Infrastructure™ (DRI) is a field of practice. It addresses the structural conditions — authority, accountability, and continuity — that determine whether organizations can make good decisions and hold themselves accountable over time. Organizations don't break because people are wrong. They break because the infrastructure underneath wasn't designed for the speed and scale they're operating at. DRI makes that visible.

## The Method: Coherence

Coherence is the diagnostic method for DRI. It examines three structural vertices:
- **Truth** — Is reality being accurately perceived and spoken?
- **Authority** — Does decision-making power match responsibility?
- **Continuity** — Are commitments and decisions stable over time?

When these vertices reinforce each other, the system holds. When they drift apart, people absorb the cost. This isn't about what organizations are doing wrong — it's the physics of organizations under speed and complexity.
